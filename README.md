Run the [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) IRC client with [Off-the-Record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) (OTR) encryption.


Image details
-------------

This images contains:
* the latest WeeChat from their repository
* Spelling dictionaries (aspell) for English, French, German and Dutch
* Support for scripts in Python, Lua and Perl
* [OTR](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/otr.py.html/) script
* [wee-slack](https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack) script
* [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/weechat.html) script
* Dependency for the [whatsapp](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/whatsapp.py.html/) script


Run from Docker Hub
-------------------

A pre-built image is available on [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/aairey/weechat-otr) and can be run as follows:

```bash
docker run -t -i aairey/weechat-otr
```

The container will start up with the [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) client. Within [WeeChat](https://weechat.org), configure your nick, username, realname:

```bash
/set irc.server.freenode.nicks alice
/set irc.server.freenode.username alice
/set irc.server.freenode.realname "Alice Springs"
```

Finally, connect to freenode:

```bash
/connect freenode
```

Run headlessly
--------------

Since `v2.1` it is possible to run weechat in headless mode, using the binary `weechat-headless`.

Sample working docker-compose.yml file that I use personally:

```yaml
weechat:
# script to run the old version manually in tmux (for interactive password prompt)
# docker run -e "TERM=screen-256color" -v /path/to/weechat/config/:/home/guest/.weechat -p 9001:9001 -ti docker.io/aairey/weechat-otr:v1.9.1 -a
  image: docker.io/aairey/weechat-otr:v2.1
  environment:
    TERM: screen-256color
    LANGUAGE: en_US:en
    LANG: en_US.UTF-8
    LC_ALL: en_US.UTF-8
    WEECHAT_PASSPHRASE: "${WEECHAT_PASSWORD}"
  entrypoint: 'weechat-headless'
  ports:
    - 9001:9001
  volumes:
    - /path/to/weechat/config:/home/guest/.weechat
```

You can set your decrypt password in a file named `.env` next to your docker-compose.yml (make sure it is in your `.gitignore`!)

Build from Source
-----------------

1. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed.
3. Clone _docker-weechat-otr_ from [GitHub](https://github.com/aairey/docker-weechat-otr)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aairey/docker-weechat-otr.git
   ```
4. Build the docker image

   ```bash
   cd docker-weechat-otr
   docker build -t aairey/weechat-otr .
   ```

5. Run a docker container with that image

   ```bash
   docker run -t -i aairey/weechat-otr
   ```

Use OTR Encryption
------------------

Within [WeeChat](https://weechat.org), you can use [OTR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) encryption as follows:

1. Start a private conversation without encryption:
 
   ```
   /query bob hello
   ```

2. Within the private chat buffer, start the encrypted session

   ```
   /otr start
   ```
   It may take a few seconds until the encrypted conversation is established.

For more info, run `/help otr` in the server buffer to view the OTR help.

Storing Configuration Permanently
---------------------------------

The instructions above show an easy way to try out [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) and [OTR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) encryption.

However, if you use [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) regularly, you may soon find it annoying that all data in the [Docker](http://docker.io) container is lost as soon as [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) exits:

  * You need to configure your nick each time you start the container (`/set irc.server.freenode.nicks alice`)
  * [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) generates new [OTR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) keys and fingerprints each time it starts.
  * All conversation logs are gone once [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) quits.

If you start using [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) regularly, you want to store data permanently. In order to do that, you need to create a directory on your host computer and map that directory to `/home/guest/.weechat` in the [Docker](http://docker.io) container:

    mkdir ~/.weechat
    chmod 700 ~/.weechat
    docker run -v ~/.weechat:/home/guest/.weechat -t -i aairey/weechat-otr

That way, all [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) data is stored in `~/.weechat` on the host system, and can be re-used in the next docker run.

Why OTR?
--------

Spiegel Online has an [interesting article](http://spon.de/aeo0j) on how intelligence agencies crack encrypted Internet communication. As the linked documents from the Snowden archives suggest, the NSA seems to have major problems with decrypting OTR messages.
